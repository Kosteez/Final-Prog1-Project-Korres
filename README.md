Description:
    This is a unique Hangman game that is short and efficient in terms of coding.
    I sort of got carried away when making this game and forgot to commit multiple times.
    
Challenge problem:
    Making all the asterisks containing the same letter in the word replace with the actual letter.
    This took a long internet and old note searching to figure it out.
